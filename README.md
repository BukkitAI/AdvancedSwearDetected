# AdvancedSwearDetection

## About
AdvancedSwearDetection is a Bukkit plugin designed to create a swear free environment by using a self learning AI to detect bypasses and block them. 

## Status
This plugin is currently under alpha development.

## Compatability
This plugin is being built with Java 7 and Bukkit 1.8.8-R0.1. In theory, this plugin should work with 1.9 and 1.10, as Bukkit plugins are usually fowards and backwards compatible. 

## Compiling

Compiling is done with Maven, and it is pretty simple, just run
`` mvn ``
or 
`` mvn clean package``
in the projects root.
